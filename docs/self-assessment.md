  Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has allowed me to translate coursework into demonstrable, professional capability. Across the program, I strengthened my ability to decompose ambiguous problems into requirements, design solutions that balance trade-offs, implement and test working systems, and communicate those decisions clearly to different audiences. The capstone process emphasized that competence is not only writing code, but also documenting intent, improving maintainability, validating data, and demonstrating that design choices are grounded in standards and real-world constraints. 
  
  My work with data structures and algorithms sharpened my ability to select the right tool for the problem and to justify that selection. Rather than defaulting to simplistic approaches, I worked on evaluating efficiency, complexity, readability, and maintainability. Implementing and enhancing a hash table reinforced how core structures affect performance and usability, particularly when scaling from small test inputs to realistic datasets. This experience strengthened my ability to design computing solutions using algorithmic principles while managing trade-offs between speed, memory usage, and clarity.
  In software engineering and design, I developed stronger instincts around architecture, modularity, and requirements-driven development. Working with databases, I gained practical experience designing and interacting with persistent data in ways that support application functionality and reliability. This experience reinforced that database work is not isolated from software design: schema choices, validation, and query patterns directly influence system correctness, performance, and user experience. Security has become a consistent thread across how I approach development. Even when a project is not “security-focused,” I now evaluate where input validation, authentication, authorization, and least-privilege thinking belong in the architecture. This security mindset affects how I design interfaces, how I handle data, and how I reason about future changes that could introduce risk.
  
  The artifacts in this ePortfolio work together as a cohesive representation of my growth. The DriverPass artifact emphasizes design thinking and stakeholder-driven architecture. The Hash Table artifact demonstrates algorithmic reasoning, efficiency, and clean implementation. The Grazioso Salvare MongoDB artifact highlights database competency and practical data-driven development. Together, they show how I design, build, and communicate computing solutions that deliver value while considering maintainability, performance, and security.
